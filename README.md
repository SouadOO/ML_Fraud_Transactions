# ML_Fraud_Transactions

In this project we will see how machine learning through text classification can be used to detect fraud in mobile money transfer platforms using the following tools:

	- Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, jupyter notebook
	
We are going to build an intelligent model which can be able to learn and tell in the future if a message is fraudulent or not, based on dataset from Kaggle.

The main parts of this project are:

  - 1-Data Cleaning: 
	clean data based on data analysis and data visualization

  - 2-Data Preprocessing:
	preprocessing data (feature encoding,scaling,dimension reduction)

  - 3-Model Building: 
	building two models Random forest and SVM by training the model, tuning the parametrs and test 


NB: data repository contains all the data, but it is not availabe in gitlab because of its huge size (1.6 GB)
